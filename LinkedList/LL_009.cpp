The main focus in this question is on the digit 9 which creates all the changes otherwise for other digits we have
 to just increment their value by 1 but if we change the nodeâ€™s value with the value 9 it makes a carry which then
 has to be passed through the linked list.

/// Find the last node in the linked list which is not equal to 9. Now there are three cases:

1. If there is no such node i.e. the value of every node is 9 then the new linked list will contain all 0s and a single
1 inserted at the head of the linked list.

2. If the rightmost node which is not equal to 9 is the last node in the linked list then add 1 to this node and return
 the head of the linked list.

3. If the node is other than the last node i.e. every node after it is equal to 9 then add 1 to the current node and
 change all the nodes after it to 0.*/
