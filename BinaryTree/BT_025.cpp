// Why we need Binary Lifting
// For every query of the form (u, v) we want to find the lowest common ancestor of the nodes u and v
// Recursive code for find the LCA takes O(N) time to find the LCA of two nodes. For Q queries it will take O(NQ) time
// There is a better way to do that, Binary Lifting
//  Which will take O(NlogN) for preprocessing the tree and O(logN) for each LCA query.
